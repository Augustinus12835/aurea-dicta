# Teaching Style Guide

## Overview
This guide defines the teaching and narration style for automated educational video generation. It is content-agnostic and applies to any subject area.

## Core Teaching Philosophy

### First Principles Approach
- Strip away jargon to reveal fundamental concepts
- Start with the human problem that a concept solves
- Build understanding logically from basics to complex
- Emphasize "why" before "what" before "how"

### Learner-Centric Focus
- Use learner's own experiences and knowledge as anchors
- Relate abstract concepts to tangible, familiar objects
- Address common misconceptions proactively
- Assume intelligent but non-expert audience

## Voice & Tone Characteristics

### Concise Conversational Style
**Goal:** Natural delivery, zero waste. Every word earns its place.

### Conversational Elements (Use Strategically)
**Sentence Starters (1-2 per script):**
- "Here we'll look at..."
- "Think about..."

**Transitions (Minimal):**
- "So..." (start of new concept)
- "Now..." (shift focus)

**Emphasis (When Critical):**
- "Key point:" (before crucial concept)
- "Remember:" (callback to earlier point)

### Avoid Entirely
- "Let me just..."
- "Essentially..."
- "You see?"
- "Right?"
- "Make sense?"
- "The key thing is..."
- "You need to understand..."
- "This is very important..."

### Efficient Speech Patterns
- **Contractions:** Use (it's, we're, don't) but sparingly
- **NO filler words:** No "um", "uh", "basically", "actually", "kind of"
- **NO redundancy:** Say it once, move on
- **NO rhetorical questions:** State facts directly
- **Active voice:** Always

### Inclusive Language (Minimal)
- **"We":** Only when doing something together ("We calculate...")
- **"You":** Only when action required ("You'll notice...")
- **Default:** Direct statements ("This has known properties.")

## Teaching Techniques

### 1. Analogy-Driven Explanation (Efficient Version)

**Pattern:**
```
Concept → Brief Analogy → Application (3 sentences max)

Example:
"[Concept] works like [familiar thing]. [Brief comparison].
[How it applies in practice]."
```

### 2. Progressive Building (Streamlined)

**Structure:**
1. State concept clearly
2. Show why it matters
3. Give one example
4. Move on

**Avoid:**
- Long setup stories
- Multiple similar examples
- Excessive context building
- Restating what was just said

### 3. Direct Examples (Precision Required)

**Format:**
```
Statement → Numbers → Result → Move on

"[Operation]: [specific values] equals [result]."

NOT: "So if we want to [do something], we take [value],
and we [operation] it by [value], right? So [value]
[operation] [value] gives us [result]."
```

**Rules:**
- State once, no repetition
- Use specific numbers when relevant
- No verbal cushioning
- Next point immediately

### 4. Visual Reference Integration (Minimal)

**Only when necessary:**
```
"See the left side - [what's shown]."
"Right side shows [contrast]."
```

**Skip entirely:**
- "Let me just get my pointer..."
- "If you look at this here..."
- "Now if we look over here..."

Frame changes happen naturally - no need to narrate them.

## Word Economy Principles

### Every Word Must Earn Its Place

**Remove These Patterns:**

**Verbal cushioning:**
- "So basically what I'm trying to say is..."
- "What I mean by that is..."
- "In other words..."
- "To put it simply..."

**Redundant confirmations:**
- "...right?"
- "...you see?"
- "...make sense?"

**Unnecessary setup:**
- "Let me just..."
- "So here's the thing..."
- "What we want to do is..."

**Patronizing language:**
- "Make sure you..."
- "You need to understand..."
- "This is very important..."

### Replace With Direct Statements

| Instead of (wordy) | Use (direct) |
|-------------------|--------------|
| "So what this means is that..." | "This means..." |
| "Let me just explain what I mean by..." | "[Term] is..." |
| "You need to understand that..." | [Just state the fact] |
| "Make sure you remember..." | "Remember:" |

### One-Time Rule

**State each concept ONCE. Never repeat unless:**
1. It's a different frame showing application
2. It's the final summary connecting concepts
3. It's a calculation step requiring verification

---

## Structural Framework

### Word Count Formula
```
Target seconds × 2.5 words/second = max word count

Example:
10 seconds → 25 words max
30 seconds → 75 words max
60 seconds → 150 words max
```

### Video Structure
1. **Opening (Frame 0):** Hook + preview
2. **Build (Frames 1-3):** Establish foundations
3. **Deepen (Frames 4-8):** Add complexity, examples
4. **Apply (Frames 9-N):** Practical takeaways
5. **Close (Final Frame):** Synthesis, integrated with content

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any script, verify:

**Timing & Length:**
- [ ] Total duration matches target
- [ ] Each frame within time budget (10-60 seconds max)
- [ ] Word count per frame: seconds × 2.5 words

**Word Economy:**
- [ ] NO filler words
- [ ] NO rhetorical questions
- [ ] NO verbal cushioning
- [ ] NO patronizing language
- [ ] Each concept stated ONCE

**Precision:**
- [ ] Direct statements, active voice throughout
- [ ] Technical terms defined in one sentence
- [ ] No redundant explanations

**Teaching Effectiveness:**
- [ ] Starts with clear concept statement
- [ ] Uses one brief analogy (if needed)
- [ ] Includes specific example
- [ ] Ends with key takeaway (no fluff)
